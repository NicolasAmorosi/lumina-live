/**
 * The look of a scene the app GENERATES, as opposed to one it reads out of a
 * file.
 *
 * Deliberately not a timer type. The same structure is meant to dress:
 *   - the utility scenes (countdown, clock, stopwatch) — today;
 *   - the Overlays plates (`plans/2026-09-17-panel-funciones/overlays.md`);
 *   - the Bible/text projection settings, hardcoded in `output-view.tsx` today
 *     and listed as debt in `docs/knowledge/07-roadmap-and-debt.md`.
 *
 * Which is why it holds no strings: a scene's own text fields belong to the
 * scene (a plate has a title and a subtitle, a countdown has a title and a
 * message), and only their STYLE is shared.
 *
 * ## On the hex values below
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` forbids a hardcoded colour in a component, and this does not
 * break that rule: these are default *content* values, stored in a row and
 * editable by the operator — the same category as a program's name, not the
 * same category as a Tailwind class. Every default is a literal from the
 * church's own ALPS palette (see `docs/knowledge/06-ui-and-theme.md`), so a
 * scene nobody customizes still looks like the rest of the app.
