 * renames and edits like any program name, so they are written once, in the
 * language of the first launch (main's dictionary, `seed.*`), and never follow
 * a later change of language.
 *
 * No ids: these are an INPUT to the seed (`db/seed/seed-utility-scenes.ts`),
 * which runs once ever and hands out real row ids. Seeding again whenever the
 * table happens to be empty would mean an operator can never be rid of a scene
 * they deleted — so "was this database seeded" is its own flag
 * (`utility.seeded`), not a row count.
