   * 3. **Otherwise the first one.** What the app always did, now only as a
   *    last resort: it is an insertion order nobody chose.
   *
   * Reading settings at call time rather than subscribing is deliberate and
   * safe here because `App` hydrates this AFTER `loadSettings()` — the one
   * ordering that matters, and the reason the Bible tab does not load them on
   * its own mount any more.

 * three-metre screen, and the short form every church actually uses («RV1909»)
 * is a preference, not a fact the app can derive: a Spanish congregation
 * writes RV60 and an Italian one writes NR94. So there is no second `abbrev`
 * column and no formatting rule here — the name IS the label, and Ajustes ▸
 * Biblia is where it gets shortened.
 *
 * `null` for an unknown id rather than a placeholder: a saved program whose
 * version was deleted has a `set null` FK, and printing «(desconocida)» under
 * a verse in front of the congregation would be worse than printing nothing.
