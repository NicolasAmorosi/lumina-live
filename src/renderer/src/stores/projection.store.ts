/**
 * `selectOutput` builds a fresh object every call, and `preload` makes it
 * deeply nested — so neither `Object.is` nor `useShallow` can tell "same
 * output" from "new object". Memoizing identity in ONE place lets both the
 * effect subscription and the live monitor use the default comparator, instead
 * of each carrying its own workaround (a JSON equalityFn here, a useShallow
 * there) for the same problem.
 *
 * The memo compares the *inputs* `selectOutput` actually reads, by reference,
 * rather than serializing its result. It used to build the output and
 * `JSON.stringify` it on every single store notification — and the store's
 * busiest writer by far is `setMediaStatus`, which the projection window
 * drives at roughly 4 Hz per playing element and which no field of the output
 * depends on. Every one of those notifications paid for a full object build
 * plus a serialization of a deck's worth of slide urls, only to conclude
 * nothing had changed.
 *
 * Reference comparison is sound here because every one of these fields is
 * replaced immutably by the store, never mutated in place. It is also what
 * makes the identity stable no matter which subscriber calls first: two
 * states that differ only in `mediaStatus` produce the same input tuple and
 * therefore the same cached object, instead of racing over one slot of
 * serialized output — the single-slot thrash React documents as a cause of
 * `useSyncExternalStore` render loops.
