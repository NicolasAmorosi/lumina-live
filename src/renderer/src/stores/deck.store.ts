   *   for: a ready deck's thumbnail comes from `deck:statuses`, and its error,
   *   if any, comes back from `ensure()` the moment someone does open it.
   * - Reaching `ready` with no DTO in hand drops the entry instead of
   *   recording a body-less "ready" — the DTO only ever arrives through
   *   `peek`/`ensure`, i.e. for decks the operator actually opened. The one
   *   exception is an `ensure` still in flight for that same asset: main
   *   pushes `ready` a moment BEFORE the call resolves, and dropping the entry
   *   in that window would flash `DeckConversionStatus`'s "Preparando…" over a
   *   deck that is in fact finished (`!entry` reads as "queued" there).
