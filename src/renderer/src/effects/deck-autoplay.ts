 *   slide index is derived from the audio element's own clock. Every
 *   `media-status` re-derives which slide should be up and re-arms a single
 *   timeout, so a ten-minute soundtrack cannot accumulate drift — the timer is
 *   a latency optimization, not the clock.
 * - **detached** (after the operator navigates by hand, or when there is no
 *   soundtrack): a monotonic deadline chain. The music keeps playing exactly
 *   where it was — the operator moved the slide, not the song — and advancing
 *   resumes relative to the slide they picked.
