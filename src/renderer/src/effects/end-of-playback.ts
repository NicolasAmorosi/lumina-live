 * projector. This mirrors the existing rule for a standalone audio track
 * (`projection-sync.ts`'s `ended` handler), extended to content that
 * actually occupies `base`.
 *
 * `MediaStatus.ended` is sticky on the DOM element and gets rebroadcast on
 * mount (`use-media-status-reporter.ts`), and the deck soundtrack always
 * reuses the same target key (`audio:deck-soundtrack`) across different
 * decks/plays. Comparing `status.epoch` against the *current* epoch is what
 * stops a stale `ended: true` from an earlier video or an earlier deck's
 * soundtrack from clearing the new one.
