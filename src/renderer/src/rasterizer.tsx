 * Offscreen slide rasterizer. This window has no UI and no domain logic: main
 * hands it a `worship://raster/<jobId>` URL, it renders every PDF page to a
 * canvas at the requested width and hands the encoded bytes back one page at a
 * time. Main does all the file writing.
 *
 * It lives in the renderer (not a Node worker) because rasterizing needs a real
 * Canvas2D and Chromium already has one — see src/main/slides/rasterizer.ts for
 * why the native-canvas alternative was rejected.
