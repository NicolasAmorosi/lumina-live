 * The multi-line counterpart to `Input`, and deliberately its exact border,

 * eight classes copied from `Input` into a feature (which is where this came
 * from) drift apart the first time the ring or the radius is touched.
 *
 * `resize-none` is the default rather than a call-site decision: every
 * textarea in this app lives inside a panel with a fixed width and its own
 * scroll, and a user-dragged corner there does not grow the panel — it just
 * overlaps what is under it.
