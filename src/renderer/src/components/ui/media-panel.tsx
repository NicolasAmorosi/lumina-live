 * The one bordered container every media-transport row lives in — the live
 * panel, the preview bar, the deck transport. A single shared shell is what
 * keeps all three visually identical instead of drifting apart one Tailwind
 * tweak at a time.
 *
 * `min-w-0` is load-bearing: this shell sits directly in a CSS grid row, and
 * without it a track name with no break points (an unspaced filename) sets
 * this box's automatic min-width to its own content size instead of 0,
 * ballooning the whole row past the column and pushing every row's trailing
 * button out of the clipped, unreachable overflow — the truncating label
 * inside never gets a chance to shrink.
