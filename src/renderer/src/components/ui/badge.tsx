/**
 * Tint carries the meaning, `text-foreground` carries the text.
 *
 * Every colored variant used to be `bg-<color>/20 text-<color>` — tint and
 * label in the same hue, which is the classic way to fail contrast. Measured
 * against the real tokens in the dark theme (the default, and the one used in
 * a darkened booth) the nine variants landed between **2,18:1 and 3,19:1**,
 * against the 4,5:1 WCAG AA asks of text this size. Keeping the identical tint
 * and only swapping the label to the foreground token takes the same badges to
 * **~12,5–13,8:1**, and the color still says what kind of content it is —
 * which is the entire job the `--wa-badge-*` tokens have.
 *
 * The three semantic tints match the content ones at /20 so no variant reads
 * as a weaker version of the others now that none of them is carrying the hue
 * in its text. `neutral` is left alone: it was never color-on-its-own-tint,
 * and being quieter than the rest is the point of it.
