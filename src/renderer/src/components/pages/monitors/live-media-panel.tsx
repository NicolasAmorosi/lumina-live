 * one place: the video (if the base content is one), the current deck's own
 * soundtrack (if it has one), and every standalone audio track sent live
 * independently. Any number of these can sound at once; this panel is what
 * keeps that legible instead of leaving the operator guessing what's on.
 * A live image gets a row too, even though it has nothing to play — just its
 * name and a way to clear it back to empty. A live time scene gets the full
 * transport of its clock, which is the one live thing whose value moves
 * without anybody touching it. Every plate that is up gets one too — its
 * auto-hide count and the X that takes it down.
 *
 * Renders nothing at all when silent, so a service with no audio in play
 * looks exactly like it did before this panel existed.
