 * actually going out to the projector), the LIVE monitor, and below it the
 * live equivalent of the centre column's grid — a deck's slides or a
 * passage's verses, whichever is on air. The preview monitor used to live
 * here too; it is pinned in the centre column now, next to what it previews.
 *
 * The monitor itself is a bare stage (`components/ui/monitor.tsx`), so all
 * of its former status text (BLACK/LOGO/disconnected) lives here in the
 * header instead — see `useLiveStatus`. The slide counter used to live here
 * too; it's redundant with `DeckTransport`'s own counter and the highlighted
 * tile in `LiveContentGrid`, so it was dropped rather than shown three times.

          scrolling body for a while, which put it 6px lower and 18px narrower
          than the PREVIEW row; it caps its own height instead, so any number
          of tracks only ever takes part of the live grid's room. */}
