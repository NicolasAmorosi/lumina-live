/**
 * The scene as the projector would draw it, while it is being edited.
 *
 * The SAME `OutputView` the projection window and both confidence monitors
 * use, fed by the SAME `timerOutputFor` — which is the whole point, and the
 * rule from `CLAUDE.md`: a preview drawn by a second, simpler renderer is a
 * preview that can disagree with the projector, and the operator would only
 * find out in front of the congregation.
 *
 * The clock is the scene's RESTING value, not the armed timer's: this is the
 * editor, and a countdown here should read as its full duration rather than as
 * whatever is running elsewhere. `editorRestingClock` and not `initialClock`,
 * because «comenzamos a una hora» rests at zero for the rest of the day once
 * its hour has gone by — and a preview that falls into the end state on its
 * own is a preview that answers a question the operator did not ask.
 * `INSTANT_TRANSITION` keeps `epoch` fixed, so `OutputView`'s `sameEpoch`
 * short-circuit means typing a title re-renders the text without ever running
 * a scene transition — the fade the end state carries is its own, and does
 * play here (see `TimerScene`).
 *
 * `atEnd` swaps that resting clock for a countdown HELD AT ZERO — which is not
 * a preview mode but the very state the projector rests in when the count runs
 * out, so the end message, its own type and the two hides are drawn by exactly
 * the code that will draw them on the night. Without it the whole «Al terminar
 * la cuenta» group would be configured blind.
