/**
 * The verse as the projector would draw it, while its style is being edited.
 *
 * The SAME `OutputView` the projection window and both confidence monitors
 * use, fed by the SAME `bibleOutputFor` — the rule from `CLAUDE.md` and the
 * reason `ScenePreview` is built the same way: a preview drawn by a second,
 * simpler renderer is a preview that can disagree with the projector, and the
 * operator would only find out in front of the congregation. It is also what
 * makes the auto-fit honest, since the measurement runs here against a stage
 * of the very same proportions.
 *
 * `long` swaps a two-word verse for a long one. Not a decoration: it is the
 * only way to see what «Shrink to fit» actually does before Sunday, in
 * the same spirit as the time-scene editor's «Preview the end».
 *
 * The version label is the DEFAULT version's real name rather than a
 * placeholder, so «Show the version» previews the string that will really be
 * on screen — including how long it is, which is the thing worth finding out
 * here rather than mid-service.
 *
 * `INSTANT_TRANSITION` keeps `epoch` fixed, so `OutputView`'s `sameEpoch`
 * short-circuit means dragging a slider re-renders the verse without ever
 * running a scene transition.
