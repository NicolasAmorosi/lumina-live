 * Left to right is browse -> stage -> broadcast, which is why the go-live
 * control sits at the far end of that path and nowhere else. All three
 * columns are equal-width — none of the three jobs (browsing, staging,
 * broadcasting) is visually more important than the others. The centre and
 * right columns mirror each other on purpose: a fixed monitor on top, the
 * same kind of grid underneath — the only difference is whether it's staged
 * or already on the projector.

            Electron cannot honour that minimum, on a screen short enough that
            the resources panel would otherwise be squeezed to a few pixels and
