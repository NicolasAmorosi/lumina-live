/**
 * A time scene as a row of the media transport — the whole control surface of
 * a countdown, a clock or a stopwatch, in the two columns where the operator
 * is already looking.
 *
 * It is rendered by `LiveMediaPanel` and by the centre column's preview bar,
 * with the same controls in both, so a scene can be driven before it is
 * projected and after it is. `clockForScene` is what makes that safe: the two
 * rows can be on screen at once for the same scene, and both read the
 * projector's copy of the clock when there is one, so they can never show two
 * numbers for one timer.
 *
 * ## Which tool gets which control
 *
 * - **Pause and restart** belong to the two tools that have something to
 *   start: `countdown` and `stopwatch`. A wall clock and a countdown to a time
 *   of day are always running by definition, and a disabled play button is an
 *   invitation to press something that cannot mean anything.
 * - **The seek bar** belongs to `countdown` alone — the only tool with a total
 *   for a position to be inside. A stopwatch and a clock have no end; a
 *   countdown to a time of day has no start, and dragging it would mean
 *   editing the scene's target hour, which is the editor's job.
 * - **The readout** belongs to all four, because every one of them is a number
 *   the operator has to be able to read without looking at the projector.
