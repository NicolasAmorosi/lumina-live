 * projector's from decode-timing jitter alone. The drift-correction effect

 * A video embedded inside the live slide, laid over the slide image in the

 * ## Why it reconstructs the image's box instead of filling the stage
 *
 * The slide is painted by an `<img class="size-full object-contain">`, so on a
 * stage whose shape differs from the deck's it is letterboxed: the pixels the
 * rect is relative to occupy only part of this element. Positioning against
 * the stage would put the video off the slide by exactly the size of the black
 * bars. So the box `object-contain` produced is rebuilt here — `min(100cqw,
 * ratio * 100cqh)` is literally the contain formula — and the rect is applied
 * inside it in percentages.
 *
 * That needs BOTH container-query axes, and `cqh` only exists under
 * `container-type: size`; the view's own root is an `inline-size` container
 * (which is all the `cqw` type sizes everywhere else need). Hence the private
 * sized container here, which shadows nothing: no descendant of this element
 * reads a container unit from the root.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT do
 *
 * It never unmounts on an overlay. Covering is opacity + pause, the same
 * bargain `LiveVideo` makes and for the same reason — a `<video>` torn down
 * and rebuilt on every NEGRO is the documented road to
 * `PIPELINE_ERROR_DECODE`. And it captures no frozen frame on the way out:
 * the still slide underneath already shows this video's poster frame, drawn
 * there by LibreOffice, so there is nothing to preserve.

/**
 * Renders a `ProjectionOutput`. The projection window and both confidence

 *
 * Type sizes are in `cqw`, not `vw`: the root is a container, so the exact same
 * markup scales from a 240px monitor to a 4K projector with no per-size
 * variants. Video/image/slide media scale the same way, but by `object-contain`
 * on a `size-full` element rather than by type size: a source smaller than the
 * output (a 360p video, say) is stretched up to fill it — never left at native
 * size — while keeping its aspect ratio, so a monitor never shows content
 * smaller, relative to its box, than the projector shows it.
 *
 * ## Scene transitions
 *
 * `output.transition.epoch` only advances when the control window begins a
 * genuinely new scene (`beginScene()` in `projection.store.ts`) — never for
 * navigating within what's already live (a slide, a verse). That's the
 * signal this component watches: an unchanged epoch always updates the
 * current layer in place (an un-keyed `src`/content swap, same as before
 * transitions existed at all — critical for the slide anti-flash comment
 * above), while a changed epoch retains the previous scene as an "outgoing"
 * layer under a fresh "incoming" one and fades between them per
 * `output.transition.style`/`durationMs`. At most two layers ever exist —
 * a transition that arrives mid-flight drops the older one immediately
 * rather than growing a queue.
 *
 * The persistent `<video>` (kept mounted independent of any layer — see
 * `LiveVideo`) participates in the same fade: covering/uncovering it with
 * NEGRO/LOGO is a real transition between "the video" and "an opaque scene",
 * so it needs to know which side of the current transition (if any) it's on
 * — see `videoRole` below. It is always the side that is ENTERING, because
 * the element that exists during a transition is by construction the one
 * belonging to the output that just arrived: the moment `base` stops being a
 * given video, `videoUnderlay` either goes `null` or changes epoch, and the
 * old element unmounts in the same push that starts the new scene (re-keying
 * a playing video is what produces `PIPELINE_ERROR_DECODE` — see
 * `.claude/knowledge/worship-protocol-range-and-video-lifecycle.md`, and it
 * is why there is only ever one).
 *
 * What fades OUT in its place is a still of its last frame, drawn into a
 * canvas as the element is torn down (`captureFrame` / `FrozenFrame`) and
 * mounted on the outgoing layer. One decoder, a real crossfade, and over
 * 300ms indistinguishable from fading the moving picture itself.
 *
 * `mode === "preview"` never animates (`shouldAnimate`): the preview monitor
 * moves with every ↑/↓ and would feel laggy if it did.
