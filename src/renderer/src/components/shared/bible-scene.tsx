 * against. Without it a shrunk verse fits the frame EXACTLY, which on a
 * projector with any overscan at all means the first and last lines are cut in
 * half; measured in the editor's own preview, a 12 cqw verse settled at a size
 * whose block was 252 px tall inside a 252 px stage. 8 % of the height top and
 * bottom leaves the 84 % that broadcast has called the title-safe area for
 * sixty years.
 *
 * `cqw` and not `cqh`, which would read more naturally: `OutputView`'s root is
 * an `inline-size` container, so it has no block axis to query and a `cqh`
 * there silently resolves against the small VIEWPORT instead — which on a
 * 240 px confidence monitor inside a maximised control window is an enormous
 * number. See the note on `SlideVideo`'s own overlay in `output-view.tsx`,

/**

 *
 * Measures the BLOCK and not the paragraph, deliberately: the reference line
 * is inside the same bounded box and the verse may not push it off the stage
 * to make room for itself.
 *
 * But it measures the block against the SPACE, not against the block's own
 * overflow. `scrollHeight > clientHeight` reads as "too tall" only while the
 * block is at its `max-h-full` ceiling; below it the block is content-sized,
 * and the comparison degenerates into "is any ink outside its own line boxes"
 * — which a `line-height` below the font's content area (≈1.36 for Noto Sans,
 * and the operator can pick 0.8) makes permanently true AT EVERY SIZE. That is
 * what collapsed a verse to `minSizeCqw` and made all four sliders in
 * «Versículos» look dead: measured at 0.8 leading, the block reported 20 px of
 * content in an 18 px box at 1.5 cqw and 58 in 56 at 12 cqw, so the search
 * never found a size that fit and always returned its floor.
 *
 * The width leg stays a comparison against the block, and correctly so: the
 * block's width is fixed at `maxWidthCqw`, so there `scrollWidth` really does
 * mean "a word is wider than the column".
 *
 * The font size is written straight onto the element rather than round-tripped
 * through React: a measurement needs the browser to have laid the text out
 * already, and a state update per probe would be seven renders (and seven
 * frames of visibly resizing text) to answer one question. The caller commits
 * the ANSWER to state, so the value React then writes is the value already on
 * the element and nothing flashes.
