 * Shown wherever the previewed item's source file is gone from disk — a

 * It carries the repair, not just the diagnosis: the file has almost always
 * been moved rather than deleted (a renamed folder, a different USB stick),
 * and relocating keeps the row's id, so the programs that use it and the
 * order of service being assembled stay intact. Re-adding the file from
 * Recursos would create a second asset and leave all of that pointing at the
 * broken one.
