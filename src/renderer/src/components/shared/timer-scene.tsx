/**
 * A generated time scene, drawn from an absolute mark.

 * This component is the whole reason the projection window can show a running

 * `ProjectionOutput` holds a fixed instant, and the ticking lives here, in the
 * leaf that renders it. Nothing above re-renders per second — not the layer,
 * not `OutputView`, not `ProjectionApp` — so the scene never re-animates and
 * `sceneContentKey` never moves.
 *
 * Three things are decided here rather than upstream, and all three are
 * FORMATTING of the very same mark (see `TimerFormat`): clamping at zero or
 * running into negative numbers, the whole end state (the message swap with
 * its own type, the two optional hides and the fade between the two readings
 * — see `SceneEnd`), and the colour triggers. Having the control window
 * decide any of them would mean a clock in the control window and a push at
 * the instant zero passes — which is a full scene transition one minute
 * before the service starts.
 *
 * Rendered by the projector AND by both confidence monitors, through
 * `OutputView`, so what the operator reads is the same number the
 * congregation reads, formatted by the same function. The end fade runs in
 * every mode, unlike `OutputView`'s own scene transitions (which a PREVIEW
 * monitor never plays): this one is not a change of scene, it is part of how
 * this scene draws itself, and a monitor that cut where the projector fades
 * would be a monitor telling the operator something untrue.
