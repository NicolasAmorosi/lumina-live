 * One row of the media transport UI — the live global panel, the preview

 * drift in shape. Everything the operator needs to read (what it is, where it
 * is, how long it is) is always visible; nothing is behind a hover.
 *
 * ## The two lines
 *
 * **Identity and commands on top, position below.** The first line is icon,
 * name and every *control* (pause, level, dismiss); the second is the seek
 * bar spanning the full width, flanked by its two clocks. Stacking them is
 * what makes a row with several controls legible: while the scrubber shared
 * the first line it was squeezed to a `w-28` stub between fixed-size buttons,
 * which is both an unusable seek target and a visually crowded row. Full
 * width also means the bar's pixels map to the track at a useful resolution —
 * a second of a 40-minute sermon is no longer a sub-pixel.
 *
 * Between the two sits the optional `readout`: a value that is not a position
 * on any timeline, which is what a timer's number is (a wall clock has none, a
 * countdown's runs backwards and can go negative). It is text, not a control,
 * so it goes with the identity half of the line rather than with the buttons.
 *
 * Every control on the first line is a fixed-size `IconButton`, and the label
 * is the only element allowed to grow or shrink (`min-w-0 flex-1 truncate`) —
 * a very long file name eats into the label's own space, it never pushes a
 * button out of the row, and the controls always land in the same spot
 * regardless of label length.
 *
 * Content with no timeline (an image, a verse, a text) renders the first line
 * only — see `durationSeconds`.
