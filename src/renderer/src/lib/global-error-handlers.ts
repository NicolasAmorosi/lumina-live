 * but it means a rejection had **nowhere to surface**: no `catch`, no
 * `unhandledrejection` listener, and React's error boundaries never see a
 * promise. A full disk, a locked database or a missing LibreOffice would
 * simply… not happen, silently, and the operator would be left wondering why
 * the click did nothing.
 *
 * Toast rather than a dialog on purpose: this fires for things that are often
 * recoverable, and a modal in the middle of a service is worse than the
 * failure it reports. Everything also goes to the console for a post-mortem.
 *
 * Returns the teardown, so a caller that mounts this can unmount it.
