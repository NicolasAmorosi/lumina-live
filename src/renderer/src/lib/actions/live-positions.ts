/**
 * Folds "where each live media element actually is" back into "where it would
 * start if it had to be mounted again".
 *
 * `startAtSeconds` is a mount-time seek, not a position: the projection window
 * applies it exactly once per element (`AudioTrackElement`, `LiveVideo`) and
 * never again. That is right for as long as the element lives, and wrong the
 * moment it has to be rebuilt — which is precisely what closing, reopening or
 * moving the projection window does. Replaying main's snapshot into a fresh
 * window mounted every audio track and the live video at the point the
 * operator originally chose, so a ten-minute backing track went back to zero.
 *
 * For a deck with a soundtrack it was worse than restarted audio: in "synced"
 * mode the slide cursor is derived from the audio clock
 * (`effects/deck-autoplay.ts`), and that module's `seededEpoch` recovery has
 * already been spent on the deck's first play — nothing re-seeks the new
 * element. A soundtrack back at 0 therefore dragged the deck back to slide 1
 * in front of the congregation.
 *
 * Called only by whoever is about to lose the projection window. The last
 * `mediaStatus` report is at most one `timeupdate` tick old (~250 ms), which
 * is the best answer available and needs no new channel — main deliberately
 * knows nothing about what is live. Elements that never reported are left
 * alone, and nothing else about a track is touched: `paused` is the operator's
 * own declarative state and has to survive untouched.
