/**
 * The transport: start, pause, resume, reset and seek a scene's clock.
 *
 * These live in the actions layer because every one of them spans two stores
 * and, above all, because none of them can decide on its own WHERE its result
 * belongs. A scene's clock lives in one of two places, sometimes both:
 * `projection.store`'s `base` holds the copy the projector is drawing, and
 * `utility.store`'s `run` holds the one the operator armed without projecting
 * anything. `clockForScene` reads those two back in that order and
 * `commitClock` writes them in the same one — which is what lets the PREVIEW
 * row, the LIVE row and the Utilities list all carry a transport for the same
 * scene and still show one number.
 *
 * None of these begins a new scene. Pausing a countdown changes one field of
 * what is already on screen; treating it as a new scene would cross-fade the
 * projector into an almost identical copy of itself, mid-service.
