/**
 * The element that took focus from a pointer press, if the focused one did.
 *
 * Enter, Space and the arrows on a button mean two different things depending
 * on how the operator got there. Reached with Tab, they are that button's own
 * keys. Clicked, they are not: Chromium focuses a button on click, so after
 * touching «Pause» or a resource tile, Enter pressed that button again instead
 * of going live, which is the one key an operator presses blind — and after
 * clicking GO LIVE itself, → no longer moved the verse or the slide that had
 * just gone live, and Space pressed GO LIVE again (a new scene: the video and
 * the deck's music back to 0). `:focus-visible` cannot tell the two apart here.
 * Chromium flips it to true on the very keydown being handled, already in the
 * capture phase (measured 2026-10-14). So the modality is recorded when focus
 * moves instead.
 *
 * Its own module because two places ask: the global shortcuts, and
 * `VirtualGrid`, whose tiles are buttons with arrow keys of their own.
