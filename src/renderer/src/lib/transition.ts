 * drives the CSS `animation` shorthand (not `transition`): a `transition`
 * property doesn't run when the very same commit that mounts an element also
 * gives it its target value, so an `animation` — which always plays from its
 * own keyframes regardless of when it starts — is what actually fades the
 * very first frame.
 *
 * `held` pauses the animation at its start without changing anything else.
 *
 * `incomingCovers` says the entering side paints every pixel of the stage —
 * the projector's scenes, which are whole pictures stacked on each other. A
 * crossfade then holds the leaving side at full opacity under it instead of
 * fading it out: fading both lets the black behind them through, a 25% dip at
 * the midpoint (measured on the projector: an image at luma 116 into a video
 * at 131 bottomed out at 95). A time scene's text blocks are transparent over
 * a shared background, so they leave it false and both of them fade.
