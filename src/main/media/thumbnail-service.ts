/**
 * On-demand, content-keyed cache of small library thumbnails.

 * It exists to kill the per-tile `<video preload="metadata">` the library grid
 * used to mount: that is a real decoding pipeline per visible tile, and a
 * folder of a few hundred videos would open several hundred of them. A JPEG a
 * few kilobytes wide costs nothing to draw and nothing to keep.
 *
 * Two rules shape everything below:
 *
 * - **Keyed by the file's bytes (path + size + mtime), never by a hash of its
 *   content.** Hashing a 4 GB MP4 to draw a 120 px tile is absurd, and
 *   size+mtime is the very identity `slide_decks` already trusts for its
 *   cheapest cache hit. `MEDIA_THUMB_VERSION` is part of the key so changing
 *   how thumbnails are made invalidates every one of them at once.
 * - **The file name IS the index.** No table, no migration, no row that can
 *   disagree with the disk. Deleting the directory is always safe.
 *
 * Which of `nativeImage`'s two routes does the work matters a great deal —
 * one of them blocks the main thread and the other does not. See
 * `renderViaOsThumbnailer` for the measurements that settled it.

 *
 * | approach                                   | 10× 4K PNG | worst main-thread stall |
 * |--------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|
 * | `createFromPath` + `resize` (synchronous)  |    782 ms | the whole 782 ms        |
 * | `createThumbnailFromPath` (this)           |     35 ms | ~15 ms (idle baseline)  |
 *
 * An 80 ms synchronous stall per large image is a visible stutter in the
 * projection window, which is the one thing this whole plan exists to avoid.
 * As a bonus it also decodes formats `createFromPath` returns empty for (GIF,
 * and by the same route WebP/HEIC).
 *
 * Two traps, both found by measuring rather than by reading the docs:
 *
 * - For a file it cannot parse, it does not fail — it happily returns the
 *   **generic document icon**, at 512×512, ignoring `maxSize`. Left alone,
 *   a corrupt image would show a Finder icon in the middle of the library.
 * - `image.getSize()` reports the size that was *asked for*, not the size that
 *   came back (320×320 for a bitmap that is really 320×180), so it cannot be
 *   used to detect the above. The encoded bytes are the only honest source.
