/**
 * SHA-256 of a whole file, a megabyte at a time, off the main thread.
 *
 * It was the same loop with `readSync`/`openSync`, which meant a 60 MB `.pps`
 * held the event loop for the entire read — and the thread it holds is the one
 * serving the projection window, so a conversion started during a service was
 * a visible freeze on the projector. `fs.promises` puts every read on the
 * thread pool and, just as importantly, lets the loop breathe between chunks:
 * the `hash.update` CPU work is bounded by the buffer size, not by the file's.
 *
 * The chunk stays at 1 MB: bigger buys almost nothing on the read and makes
 * each `update` a longer uninterruptible block, which is exactly what this is
 * meant to avoid.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in `deck-service.ts` (where it grew up) because the
 * digest is no longer only a slide-pipeline concern: it is `media_assets`'
 * own identity column now, and the backfill below has to be able to compute
 * one without pulling in the whole conversion queue.

 * once its own bytes are known. Assets converted from now on get their hash
 * written by `runConversion` for free (it computes one anyway); this covers
 * everything that was already in the library before the column existed, plus
 * any file whose bytes changed since.
 *
 * Runs once per launch, after the window is up:
 *
 * - **asynchronous and chunked** — `hashFile` is already off-thread, and the
 *   yield between chunks keeps a long backfill from monopolizing the loop
 *   that serves the projector;
 * - **best-effort per file** — an unreadable file is skipped, not retried and
 *   not fatal. Its stamp simply stays absent and `statusesByAsset` falls back
 *   to ownership for it, exactly as before this existed;
 * - **idempotent** — a stamp that is still valid is not recomputed, so the
 *   second launch costs one indexed query and nothing else.

 * Measured on the real library: 1230 presentations, 1.78 GB, ~5 s in total,
