/**
 * Gives a fresh database the four built-in time scenes, once and only once.
 *
 * "Once" is a flag (`utility.seeded`) rather than "the table is empty", and
 * the difference is the whole behaviour: seeding an empty table would mean an
 * operator who deletes a scene they never use finds it back on Monday, and
 * deleting all four would be impossible. With the flag, deleting is deleting —
 * the panel shows an empty state and offers to create one.
 *
 * Never throws: a church that cannot seed its examples still has a working
 * app, and taking the launch down over four sample rows would be the worst
 * possible trade. Same rule the legacy-data migration follows.
