/**
 * What the projection window needs from the operating system while it exists,
 * and what happens to it when screens come and go.
 *
 * - **The screens stay awake.** A verse can sit on the projector through a
 *   forty-minute sermon. Chromium only holds off sleep while a video with
 *   sound plays, so Windows' power plan would turn the screens off, or the
 *   screen saver and then the lock screen would come up, in the middle of a
 *   service. The blocker lives exactly as long as the window.
 * - **A screen that disappears takes its window out of sight, not out of
 *   existence.** A projector that goes to standby, a cable that moves, an
 *   input switched on the projector: Windows moves a fullscreen, always-on-top
 *   window onto the laptop, over the control window. So the window is HIDDEN
 *   (`projector-screen` → `connected: false`) and put back on its own once a
 *   second screen returns. Hidden rather than closed, because every `<audio>`
 *   of the service lives in it: closing it silenced the hymn's music and the
 *   background track in the room for as long as the projector was off, and
 *   rebuilt every element when it came back.
 * - **A projector turned on after the app started receives the window** that
 *   was sitting on the laptop (the single-screen windowed mode).
 *
 * The operator's call, 2026-10-18. Every change in the list of screens is also
 * broadcast (`displays-changed`) so Settings and the next GO LIVE see it.
