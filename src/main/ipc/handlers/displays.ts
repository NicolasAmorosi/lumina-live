/**
 * The label is what the operator picks a projector by in Ajustes → Pantalla,
 * so it has to survive the case this app is actually deployed into: a booth
 * with two identical screens. Resolution alone does not — two monitors of the
 * same model are literally the same string, and choosing the wrong one sends
 * the service to the wrong wall.
 *
 * `Display.label` is the device name the OS reports (Electron ≥ 22) and is the
 * only field that distinguishes them. It can come back empty (it regularly
 * does on Linux), so the resolution stays as the fallback and as the suffix —
 * "DELL U2718Q · 3840x2160" tells the operator both which box and which
 * picture. When even that collides, an ordinal is appended, because a Select
 * with two identical options is a coin flip.
