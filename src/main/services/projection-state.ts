 * Holds the last output sent to the projection window and a reference to that

 * a fresh `projection:open` shows the window before its page has loaded, and
 * `send()`/`setAudioTracks()` calls made in that gap (goLive() runs right
 * after `openIfNeeded()`, with no wait for the page to be ready) would
 * otherwise race the renderer's own `display-content`/`audio-tracks`
 * listener — pushed while nothing is listening yet is a silent drop, not a
 * queued delivery. Pulling the last known state once mounted needs no timing
 * assumption about `did-finish-load` vs. React mounting.

   * announcing the OLD window's death over the NEW window that is on screen.
   *
   * A `closed` listener must never clear this unconditionally: `close()` is
   * asynchronous, so a reopen (`projection:open` → close the old one, create a
   * new one) delivers the OLD window's `closed` after the new one is already
   * registered, and an unconditional clear would leave main convinced there is
   * no projector while one is on screen. Comparing against the raw field
   * rather than `getWindow()` matters too: by the time `closed` fires for the
   * current window it is already destroyed, so `getWindow()` answers `null`
   * and would never match.
