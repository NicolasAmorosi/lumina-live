/**
 * Old church hymnal decks (`.pps`/`.ppt`) rarely embed their soundtrack —
 * they point at an external `.mp3` that lived next to the file on whoever's
 * Windows machine made it. That link never survives a LibreOffice round-trip
 * (verified: converting one of these to `.pptx` drops it entirely, along with
 * `showPr`), so it has to be resolved straight from the original file, once,
 * against whatever now sits beside it.
 *
 * Four rules, in order of confidence:
 *  1. The file's own hint — the external link it recorded, matched by
 *     *basename* against the deck's folder (the recorded path is someone
 *     else's Windows machine; only the filename can still be right).
 *  2. The PowerPoint convention: `<same base name>.<audio ext>`.
 *  3. Partial containment between a loose comparison key of the deck's name
 *     and each candidate's — the deck and its audio share *some* substring
 *     of their title (see `comparisonKey`). There is deliberately no "only
 *     audio file in the folder" fallback anymore: a folder holding one deck
 *     with audio and a sibling deck without one used to hand that unrelated
 *     audio to the silent deck just because it was alone in the folder.
 *  4. `null` — nothing matched, let the operator assign it by hand.

 * the thread that serves the projection window. A batch is the only thing
 * fast enough to hit this window, which is the point: the TTL is far shorter
