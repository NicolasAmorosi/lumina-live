/** Pre-converts a chunk of background (prewarm) decks' PDFs — and, for
 *  legacy `.ppt`/`.pps`, their `.pptx` timing/audio upgrade — with ONE
 *  `soffice` invocation covering the whole chunk instead of one per file.
 *  This is what makes preparing a folder of hundreds of decks minutes
 *  instead of tens of minutes: LibreOffice's own startup cost, not the
 *  per-file conversion, is what dominates at that scale (see
 *  `libreoffice.ts`'s `convertBatchToPdf`/`convertBatchToPptx`).
 *
 *  Purely an optimization: it populates `precomputedPdfByAsset`/
 *  `precomputedPptxByAsset`, which `runConversion` prefers over its own
 *  single-file `soffice` calls when present — every asset here still goes
 *  through the normal `prepareDeck`/queue/preemption machinery afterward,
 *  unchanged. A file this call fails to produce (interrupted batch, name
 *  mangled beyond matching) just falls back to that normal single-file path,
 *  so a failure here never blocks a conversion, only slows it back down to
 *  what it already was.
 *
 *  Deliberately skips warming while an interactive job is running or
 *  waiting: a batch `soffice` invocation is one process for every file in
 *  it, so soft-preempting it (the operator hitting EN VIVO mid-batch) would
 *  throw away every file's progress, not just one — the opposite of what
 *  preemption is for. The caller (`prewarm-service.ts`) simply proceeds to
 *  convert this chunk's decks one at a time in that case, exactly as before
 *  this optimization existed.
 *
 *  The same reasoning covers the two prioritized background lanes: a deck in
 *  the order of service must not wait a whole chunk's batch conversion, and
 *  preempting the batch to let it through would be worse than not batching. */
