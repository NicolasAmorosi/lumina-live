/**
 * Reads a handful of named entries out of a zip without ever holding the
 * whole archive in memory.
 *
 * The reason this exists: a `.pptx`/`.ppsx` is a zip whose bulk is media —
 * a 200 MB deck is 200 MB of images and video around a few dozen KB of the
 * XML we actually parse. `unzipSync` (fflate) takes a buffer, so using it
 * means `readFileSync`-ing the entire file first: a 200 MB synchronous read
 * plus a 200 MB allocation, on the same thread that serves the projection
 * window. Filtering entries afterwards saves the *inflate*, not the read.
 *
 * A zip is random-access by design — that is the whole point of its central
 * directory, which sits at the end and says where every entry starts. So
 * this reads the tail, walks the directory, and then reads exactly the byte
 * ranges of the entries it was asked for: kilobytes instead of megabytes, no
 * matter how big the deck is.
 *
 * Deliberately synchronous. Every read here is small and bounded, so it
 * blocks the event loop for microseconds rather than the hundreds of
 * milliseconds a whole-file read costs — which is what lets the callers
 * (`readPresentationMeta`, `extractAudioParts`, `extractHintFromOoxml`) keep
 * their synchronous signatures, and with them `MediaRepo.ensureLinkedAudio`
 * and everything above it.
