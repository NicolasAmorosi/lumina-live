/**
 * `resolveLinkedAudio` — which `.mp3` beside a hymnal deck is that deck's
 * soundtrack.
 *
 * Four rules in order of confidence, and the interesting cases are the two
 * that must NOT match: the audio that merely happens to be alone in the folder
 * (a silent deck used to adopt its neighbour's music), and the tie between two
 * equally plausible candidates, where guessing means the wrong song plays in
 * front of the congregation.
 *
 * Each test gets its own directory: the resolver caches listings for 2 s.
