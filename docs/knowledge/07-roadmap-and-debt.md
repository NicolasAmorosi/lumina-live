# 07 — Roadmap and known debt

## State of this migration

Completed: `electron-vite` scaffolding + strict TS, the design system (`components/ui`+
`shared`), the complete data layer (SQLite + Drizzle + FTS5, with a verified smoke test), the
end-to-end typed IPC contract, the `worship://` protocol, the slide pipeline with headless
LibreOffice (cross-platform, see `03-slides-libreoffice.md`), the
declarative projection window, and a working control UI for the 6 audited areas
(playlist, library, bible, PPT, black/logo, display) plus the new
saved-services module.

**Not implemented** (explicitly out of scope for this task, agreed with the user):
songs/lyrics with projectable sections.

## Debt consciously left for a later session

- ~~**Real drag & drop of OS files**~~ into the playlist/library: **implemented** — files dropped
  from the OS onto the schedule or the media browser go through `readOsFilesDrag` (`lib/dnd.ts`,
  `webUtils.getPathForFile` in the preload), and the internal library→schedule drag has its
  `onDrop` (`SchedulePanel.tsx`).

- **Bible favorites and history UI**: the `bible_favorites` and `projection_history` tables and
  their repos exist and work (`HistoryRepo.record()` is already called on every
  `projection:show`), but there's no screen that lists them yet.
- ~~**Video embedded inside a slide**~~: **implemented on 2026-09-20** as a positioned overlay.
  One hard limit remains that isn't debt but format: legacy `.ppt`/`.pps` files lose the video
  entirely, so the feature is only for `.pptx`/`.ppsx` — measured in
  [`.claude/knowledge/an-embedded-deck-video-survives-to-the-pdf-but-never-survives-a-ppt.md`](../../.claude/knowledge/an-embedded-deck-video-survives-to-the-pdf-but-never-survives-a-ppt.md).
  What does remain open: a video whose `p:pic` doesn't carry its own `a:xfrm` (it inherits the
  geometry of a layout placeholder, which the parser doesn't resolve) is discarded instead of
  guessed; the slide still looks right: the poster frame is already rasterized in its place. A
  `.wmv`/`.avi` is extracted marked `playable: false`, but since 2026-10-18 `media/deck-clips.ts`
  converts it in place with the bundled FFmpeg the first time the deck is opened.
- ~~**Configurable projection settings** for bible/text~~: **implemented on 2026-09-20**.
  The verse's style lives in the `bible.style` key of `SettingsMap` —a global style, not a row
  per preset— with `BibleStyle` (`shared/types/bible-style.ts`), its validators/normalizers and
  the first entry of `SETTINGS_NORMALIZERS`. It's edited in Settings ▸ Verses, with the
  preview drawn by the same `OutputView` as the projector, and it's saved instantly: `App`
  mirrors it to `projection.store`, which recomputes `selectOutput` **without** touching
  `sceneEpoch`, so editing what's LIVE is an in-place patch and not a transition.
- **Bible favorites UI**: `bible_favorites` still has no screen. Watch out for a decision already
  made: deleting a version does **not** delete its favorites (they're keyed by code, not by FK)
  precisely so that delete-and-reimport isn't destructive.
- **Settings screen**: six categories (Projection, Slides, Verses, Bible, System, About) with theme,
  language, `media.volume`, the per-type folders (`files.defaultFolders`) and the `slides.*` keys
  already exposed. Since 2026-10-22, Slides opens with a **LibreOffice** group (status, version and
  path, «Download LibreOffice», «Check again», «Locate soffice…» and the
  `slides.warnMissingSoffice` switch). What still has no UI is **clearing** the override
  (`slides.sofficePath`): a manually chosen path wins over automatic detection, so if it points to
  something that isn't LibreOffice the only way out is to pick another one with «Locate soffice…».

## Pre-launch review of 2026-10-18 — what was left open on purpose

The full review on that date (main, slides, renderer, UI and Windows) closed all of its critical,
high and medium findings. This was left open, each item with its reason:

- **A linked music track in WMA/AIFF isn't converted**, it's rejected (`LINKABLE_AUDIO_EXTENSIONS`
  in `ipc/handlers/library.ts`). `worship://linked-audio/<id>` serves the file as-is, and the 1229
  linked audio files of the real hymnal are MP3. If it were ever needed, it goes through
  `conversion-service.ts`.
- **The clickable `ListRow` rows can't be reached with the keyboard** (Scenes, Plates, Timers,
  Overlays). Making them focusable clashes with Enter = GO LIVE: it's an interaction decision,
  not a fix.
- **Style violations in `pages/`** (the UI review's table): the hand-written buttons of
  `media-source-bar.tsx` and of the theme selector (the rebrand to Lumina Live only changed their
  shape and focus; they're still hand-written), about 25 hand-written typography classes in
  `pages/`, the warning note duplicated between `remove-asset-confirm` and `program-side-panel`,
  and two copies of the `FieldGroup` box. They're cosmetic and each one needs a visual pass.
- **The units `s`, `px` and `%` are still written in the code.** They're typography, not words;
  the neutral color names did go through i18n.
- **The Windows package carries the better-sqlite3 prebuilds for other platforms** and their
  SQLite sources (~24 MB). Excluding them per platform is possible, but it would touch the native
  module's loading right before launch.
- **Re-seeding RV1909 with a different JSON would erase the version from the saved verses**
  (`seed-bible.ts`). It doesn't happen: the file hasn't changed since the first commit.
- **No code signing** (SmartScreen warns «Windows protected your PC») — `I1`, it costs money.
- **To check by hand on the church's PC**: Win+P on «Extend»; different scaling per monitor;
  turning the projector off and on mid-service (the window hides, the sound keeps going, and it
  comes back to full screen on its own); turning on the projector with the app already open;
  power plan; 64-bit LibreOffice on a cold first start; «Test video» with iPhone HEVC; audio
  output over HDMI; and the E2E suite against the installed `.exe` (`WORSHIP_E2E_EXECUTABLE`),
  with `WORSHIP_E2E_HYMNAL` pointing to that PC's hymnal folder so that `hymnal.spec.ts` runs too.
  And, since the rebrand to **Lumina Live** (2026-10-22), that the new installer REPLACES the
  WorshipApp one: a single shortcut, a single entry in «Installed apps», and that PC's schedules,
  library and Bibles present on the first start (`userData` stays in `%APPDATA%\worship-app`,
  same `appId`).
- **Scenes and plates saved before the rebrand keep the ALPS colors** (`#04132b`, `#84adfc`, the
  countdown in `#cd4900`/`#d0021b`): the Lumina Live defaults only dress what's created from
  2026-10-22 on, and the four example scenes are seeded only once. It's on purpose —they're the
  operator's content—; moving them to the new palette means editing them by hand.
- **Four E2E tests failed once in a full run on 2026-10-22 and passed on their own when
  repeated**: `bible.spec` «after clicking EN VIVO…» and «a file that is not a Bible…» (the
  Settings tab was unmounting under the click), `keyboard.spec` «↓ after clicking a library
  tile…» and `logo.spec` «L covers what is live…». In the next full run (that same day, with
  everything already committed) all four passed; nobody looked into whether any of them is a
  product bug.
- **The GO LIVE that opens the projector waits for its window to load** (since the slide 1 fix,
  2026-10-22): 0.2 s normally, up to 3 s with the machine busy. A key pressed in that interval
  doesn't move anything, because nothing is live yet. Before, it advanced a deck the projector
  hadn't shown yet. If it's a nuisance during a service, it can be queued.
- **What the E2E suite can't exercise**: dropping files from Finder/Explorer (`getPathForFile`
  requires a native `File`), two real screens, and the native dialogs — those are answered by
  replacing `dialog.showOpenDialog` in main (`answerOpenDialog`), so the button and everything
  after it are the real ones.
- **31 of the 35 `Select`s have no accessible name.** The ones living in a `FieldRow` are named
  only by the `role="group"`, not the combobox; the three in the Bible browser and the Schedules
  filter, by nothing. The fix is in the primitive (have `Select` take the `labelId` of the
  `FieldRow` that contains it) plus an `aria-label` on the four standalone ones.

## Cross-platform — solved

Nothing is Windows-only anymore. COM/PowerShell was removed completely and presentations are
converted with headless LibreOffice, which runs the same on macOS, Windows and Linux. LibreOffice
**isn't bundled**: the app detects it on the system (with a manual override in
`slides.sofficePath`) and, if it's missing, warns and blocks only PowerPoint conversion; PDFs,
already-converted decks and everything else keep working — see «Without LibreOffice» in
`03-slides-libreoffice.md`.

**Linux was packaged and tested for the first time on 2026-10-22**, in Docker (emulated Ubuntu
24.04 x86_64): it starts, converts with the system's LibreOffice and passes `startup.spec` and
`decks.spec`; the rest of the suite wasn't run there.

**Linux ships as a `.deb` and as an AppImage** (owner's decision, 2026-10-23). The `.deb` is the
one for Ubuntu, Debian and Mint: its postinst leaves `chrome-sandbox` setuid root if user
namespaces are missing and installs an AppArmor profile with `userns` on Ubuntu 24.04+, so it
opens with a double click and with the sandbox on. The AppImage can't do any of that: on Ubuntu
23.10+ it needs `--no-sandbox` (the README says so) and it's left for the other distributions.
`package:linux` installs to `/opt/lumina-live` (`-c.productName=lumina-live`): with the space in
«Lumina Live» the setuid sandbox wouldn't start, and the E2E suite doesn't see it because
Playwright adds `--no-sandbox` on Linux — see
`.claude/knowledge/a-space-in-the-linux-install-path-breaks-the-suid-sandbox-and-playwright-never-tests-it.md`.
Not yet tested on a real desktop Ubuntu (Docker has no AppArmor).

**Linux is experimental in 2.2.0-beta.4** (owner's decision, 2026-10-23; the README and the
landing say so). On native x86_64 under Xvfb, the projector and control renderers crash with a
deck on air (`service.spec`, `settings.spec:60`, sometimes `decks.spec:93`): `render-process-gone`
with `reason: crashed`, `exitCode: 133` (SIGTRAP, a Chromium `CHECK` with no message in the
official builds). Same with `--disable-gpu`, with and without the sandbox. And `media.spec:69`
(GO LIVE doesn't reopen a projector closed from outside) fails there, maybe because of Xvfb's
single screen and its lack of a window manager. Next: a minidump with Electron's symbols, and
testing on a desktop Linux with a GPU and two monitors.

Verified on macOS against real church decks, including a 52-slide binary `.ppt` and a fixture
with auto-advance + embedded audio. `legacy/` was removed from the repo on 2026-10-22; it's still
in the git history.

## Languages

Since 2026-10-22 the app speaks `es`, `en`, `it` and `pt` (Brazilian Portuguese). Adding another
one takes: the code in `LOCALES` (`shared/types/settings.ts`), a file in `lib/i18n/messages/` and
another in `main/i18n/messages/` (both typed against their `es`), its Bible book names in
`main/db/seed/bible-formats/book-names.ts` and its endonym in `settings.locales`. No components
touched: the dictionary maps are typed over `Locale`, so forgetting one doesn't compile.

Pending: the screenshots (`npm run screenshots`) and the landing show the interface in Spanish in
every language.
