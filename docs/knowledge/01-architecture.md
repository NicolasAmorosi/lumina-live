# 01 — Architecture

## What it is

WorshipApp is an Electron 44 app with **TypeScript + React 19 + Vite**, bundled with
`electron-vite` (not vite+tsc wired by hand — see "Why electron-vite" below). Three processes:

- **Main** (`src/main/`) — windows, SQLite DB, IPC, slide conversion with LibreOffice, in-app
  updates.
- **Preload** (`src/preload/index.ts`) — generic `contextBridge` bridge (`invoke`/`on` by
  channel string), ~35 lines that never change when features are added.
- **Control renderer** (`src/renderer/index.html` + `src/renderer/src/`) — the whole UI of the
  operator window: React + Zustand + Tailwind.
- **Projection renderer** (`src/renderer/projection.html` + `src/renderer/src/projection/`) —
  deliberately free of domain logic: a pure function of the last `ProjectionOutput` received.

## Why `electron-vite`

The reference scaffolding (`church-presenter`, archived) used bare Vite + `tsc --watch` +
`concurrently`, and had 3 build-chain bugs that were never fixed: `NODE_ENV` was never set
(dev always fell through to production), the renderer's `outDir` didn't match what main looked
for, and the Vite config was missing `root`. `electron-vite` fixes all three out of the box: it
detects the dev-server URL automatically (`process.env.ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL`), compiles the three
targets with their own `tsconfig`, externalizes `electron` and native modules, and restarts main
in watch mode. Full config in `electron.vite.config.ts` (repo root).

## Dev vs. packaged

`src/main/windows/control-window.ts` and `projection-window.ts` choose `loadURL` (dev, with HMR) vs.
`loadFile` (production) by looking at `app.isPackaged` + `process.env.ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL` — never
`NODE_ENV` by hand. **All** packaging-dependent paths (where the migrations, the Bible resources
and the user DB live) are resolved in a single file, `src/main/paths.ts` — don't repeat
`app.isPackaged ? ... : ...` anywhere else.

## The two windows

As in the legacy version (removed from the repo on 2026-10-22; still in git history at
`90d3821`): `createControlWindow()` (1400×900, minimum 1000×700, background `#162231`) and
`createProjectionWindow(displayId?)`, which is **recreated** (not reused) on every
`projection:open` and falls back to 800×600, centered, without `alwaysOnTop` when only one monitor
is connected. The minimize/restore sync between both windows lives in `main/index.ts`
(`wireMinimizeRestoreSync`).

Because the projection window is destroyed and recreated, main keeps the last `ProjectionOutput`
sent (`src/main/services/projection-state.ts`) and replays it on `did-finish-load` — otherwise,
reopening the projection leaves it black even though the control believes it is projecting
something.

## In-app updates

Main owns them (`src/main/updates/`): the control window asks for the state (`updates:getStatus`)
and listens to `update-status`. Nothing about updating reaches the projector, and the only thing
that starts without the operator asking is one check, 10 s after launch.

- **The feed is the GitHub release marked Latest**, the same one the landing's buttons resolve.
  electron-builder writes `app-update.yml` (`provider: github`) from `repository`; there is no
  `publish` block. `allowPrerelease` is set to `false` on purpose: electron-updater turns it on for
  any `-beta` version, and then the provider looks for a `beta.yml` that no release carries. That's
  why a beta is published as Latest and never as a prerelease.
- **A release has to carry `latest.yml`, `latest-mac.yml` and `latest-linux.yml`**, plus the
  `.blockmap` files for Windows' differential download. The `package:*` scripts write them to
  `release/` and don't publish anything. A release without them gives every install a 404 that only
  reaches `main.log`: nothing breaks, and nobody updates.
- **State.** `UpdateStatus` (`shared/types/updates.ts`) is a discriminated union. `unsupported` is a
  build that can't update itself: `npm run dev`, an AppImage started without `APPIMAGE`, a snap.
  Errors travel as a stable `UpdateErrorCode`, and the renderer words them. A failed launch check
  goes to `main.log` only; whatever the operator asked for says how it failed. The pure half (error
  → code, the installer each platform uses, whether to check at launch) lives in
  `update-status.ts`, which has unit tests.
- **When.** The launch check runs if `updates.autoCheck` is on and `--no-update-check` isn't on the
  command line (the E2E suite passes it). Downloading (~200 MB) waits for «Download», so it never
  competes with a livestream. Installing waits for «Restart and update» or «When the app closes».
  The launch toast (`effects/update-announcement.ts`) shows once per version
  (`updates.announcedVersion`), and its «View» opens Settings ▸ About.

| | Download | «Restart and update» | «When the app closes» |
|---|---|---|---|
| Windows (NSIS) | electron-updater, sha512 | silent install, reopens; UAC if installed for all users | silent install, doesn't reopen |
| macOS (ad-hoc) | `mac-dmg.ts`: `net.fetch`, sha512 against `latest-mac.yml` | opens the `.dmg` and quits; the operator drags it over the app | opens the `.dmg` on the way out |
| Linux AppImage / `.deb` | electron-updater, sha512 | replaces the file / `pkexec dpkg -i`, reopens | the same, on the way out |

- **macOS doesn't go through `MacUpdater`.** Squirrel.Mac rejects every new build of an ad-hoc
  signed app: see
  [`squirrel-mac-rejects-every-update-of-an-ad-hoc-signed-app.md`](../../.claude/knowledge/squirrel-mac-rejects-every-update-of-an-ad-hoc-signed-app.md).
  With a Developer ID, add the `zip` target and use `MacUpdater`; the macOS row becomes the
  Windows one and the interface doesn't change.
- **The question comes before the installer starts, never after.** «Restart and update» asks
  `quitRisks()` (`effects/draft-autosave.ts`), the same answer the close guard gets. Only with the
  OK does `installUpdate("now")` start the installer, and only once it's running does it call
  `releaseForUpdate()` and `app.quit()`. Once started, the Windows installer kills the app within
  ~1.3 s whatever the operator answers: see
  [`the-update-installer-kills-the-app-so-the-question-goes-before-it.md`](../../.claude/knowledge/the-update-installer-kills-the-app-so-the-question-goes-before-it.md).
- **«When the app closes» is not `autoInstallOnAppQuit`**, which stays `false`. With it on, any
  quit after a download would install in silence, and electron-updater only arms it when the
  download finishes anyway: see
  [`electron-updater-arms-install-on-quit-only-when-the-download-finishes.md`](../../.claude/knowledge/electron-updater-arms-install-on-quit-only-when-the-download-finishes.md).
  `updater.ts` registers its own `app.once("quit")` instead. It fires only after the close guard has
  let the quit through, so a «Cancel» installs nothing, and it does its work synchronously.
- **electron-updater is imported by default** (`import electronUpdater from "electron-updater"`).
  The named import passes `typecheck` and kills the app at launch: see
  [`a-named-import-from-a-commonjs-dependency-passes-typecheck-and-dies-at-launch.md`](../../.claude/knowledge/a-named-import-from-a-commonjs-dependency-passes-typecheck-and-dies-at-launch.md).
- **Testing.** `WORSHIP_UPDATE_FEED_URL` swaps the feed for a `generic` one and lets an unpackaged
  build update (`forceDevUpdateConfig`). It's honoured only on loopback (`loopbackFeedUrl`), so it
  can never point a real install at another host. `tests/e2e/updates.spec.ts` serves a fake
  `latest-mac.yml` and `.dmg` through it, and puts a fake `open` first on the app's `PATH`, so the
  macOS install path runs for real. The NSIS, AppImage and `.deb` installs are only tested by hand.

## Window security

`contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `sandbox: true`, **`webSecurity: true`** (unlike
common Electron shortcuts, it is not disabled here — see `02-ipc-contract.md` and the `worship://`
protocol for how local files are served without needing it). CSP declared in both HTML files.
