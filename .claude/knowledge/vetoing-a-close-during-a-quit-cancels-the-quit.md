## Vetoing a window's `close` during a quit cancels the whole quit — `will-quit` never comes, and `win.close()` does not bring it back
**Area:** build, data
**Trigger:** touching `app.on("will-quit")`/`app.on("before-quit")` in `src/main/index.ts`, anything in `src/main/windows/close-guard.ts`, or any cleanup that is supposed to run "on exit"; also before writing a CDP/automated test that closes the control window.

- **Claim:** `event.preventDefault()` inside `win.on("close")` does not *postpone* a quit, it
  **aborts** it. Electron stops the sequence there: no further windows are closed, `will-quit`
  never fires, and the app stays alive. Releasing the window afterwards with `win.close()` closes
  only that window — on macOS the app then lives on with no window at all, which looks exactly like
  a clean exit from the outside. To actually finish what the operator asked for, the answer has to
  call **`app.quit()` again**; `close-guard.ts` captures the intent in `PendingClose.wasQuit` for
  precisely that reason.

- **What this cost, measured on 2026-09-14.** `closeDatabase()` was wired to `will-quit` (to
  checkpoint the WAL, `M27`). ⌘Q → guard vetoes → operator confirms → the app exits and everything
  looks right — but `worship.db-wal` (20 632 B) and `worship.db-shm` were still on disk afterwards,
  and a `console.log` at the top of the `will-quit` handler **never printed**. The database was
  never closed. The compounding bug was mine: the "I'm asking the operator" message cleared the
  same global `quitRequested` flag the later confirmation needed, so `allowClose` took the
  `win.close()` branch. After the fix, a clean exit **deletes** `-wal` and `-shm`, which is the
  observable signature of a real `sqlite.close()` on the last connection — that file pair
  surviving a quit is the fastest way to tell this regressed.

- **`window.close()` from the renderer does not fire the cancellable `close` event at all.** It
  tears the window down directly. Three attempts to exercise the guard through
  `Runtime.evaluate("window.close()")` over CDP all "passed straight through", and a `console.log`
  as the first statement of the `close` handler proved the handler simply never ran. Nothing in
  this app calls `window.close()`, so it is not a hole in the guard — but it **cannot be used to
  test one**. Drive the real path instead: `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to
  keystroke "q" using command down'` after making the app frontmost (`set frontmost of (first
  process whose name is "Electron") to true`). The same tool reads the menu back, which is how
  "Ventana has no Cerrar" was verified: `get name of menu items of menu 1 of menu bar item
  "Ventana" of menu bar 1` → `Minimizar, Zoom, missing value, Traer todo al frente`.

- **Consequence.** Quit-time cleanup belongs in `will-quit`, never `before-quit`, now that a close
  can be vetoed: `before-quit` fires while the operator is still reading the dialog and is free to
  answer "Cancelar", so closing the database there would leave a perfectly alive app with no
  database. And whoever releases a vetoed close must resume the quit rather than close the window.
  Both halves are synchronous-only, for the reason in
  [nothing-asynchronous-survives-before-quit.md](nothing-asynchronous-survives-before-quit.md).

### Vetoing the control window's `close` was also too LATE (added 2026-10-14)

- **Believed:** vetoing the control window's `close` holds the quit until the operator answers.
  **True for the control window only.** By the time Electron delivers that `close`, it has already
  closed the projection window, which has no guard. Measured in the 2026-10-14 two-screen rehearsal:
  ⌘Q with an unsaved change, the dialog appeared, «Cancelar» was clicked, and the app stayed alive
  with the toast «Se cerró la ventana de proyección». The congregation's screen had gone dark behind
  a question whose answer was "don't". `shutdownSlides()` in `before-quit` had also already run,
  aborting the conversion in flight and the prewarm batch.
- **Fix:** `holdQuitUntilAnswered(event)` (`windows/close-guard.ts`), called first in `before-quit`.
  It `preventDefault()`s the quit itself while the control window is not cleared, then calls
  `win.close()` to start the existing guard. No window closes and no shutdown chore runs until the
  answer. "close" resumes with `app.quit()`; the second `before-quit` finds the window cleared and
  proceeds.
- **The renderer asks for two reasons now:** unsaved work, or something on air (an open projector
  with content, plates, NEGRO or LOGO).
- **Known gap, left open on purpose:** once the renderer answers `hold`, the grace timer is gone.
  If the renderer dies while its dialog is up, main waits forever and only a force quit ends it.
  The 2026-10-14 driver produced it by `pkill`ing the renderer helpers. A real crash at that exact
  moment is rare.
